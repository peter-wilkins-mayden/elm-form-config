# elm-form-config

Elm-formbuilder:  ZF-Form Configuration Tool written in Elm. 

Slogans and buzz words:
"Making Impossible States Impossible" 
"Tests are good. Impossible is better" 
"make illegal states unrepresentable"	


This might be a spreadsheet like single page application for creating valid json for an ZF-Form application. 

This is more a design exersice using the principles of modelling the problem in such a way that states that should be impossible are in fact impossible, using the type system and compiler to do the hard work. 
It might use Property based testing to throughly test the boundries.
